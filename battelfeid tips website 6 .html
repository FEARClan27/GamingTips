Battlefield 1 is a big game, with an exciting campaign and chaotic multiplayer component. In an effort to help our fine readers out, we've broken ...
Battlefield 1 is finally out today, and I highly suggest you check out my full-length review that went up earlier this week. Since I did receive an advance copy way ahead of time, I’ve been able to play the game quite a bit, not just in the beta like many have, but also through the entire campaign.
As I’m prone to do in situations like this, I like to offer some advice for players just getting started. I am hardly the greatest Battlefield player on earth, and that’s certainly true of Battlefield 1 as well, but I think I have a few tips that could prove useful across both the campaign and the multiplayer.
I’ll try to split these between the two modes. The campaign is relatively straightforward, but there are still a few things you might want to know. Multiplayer is a different animal altogether, and I’m certainly still learning there.
Here are 10 things I wish I knew when I started Battlefield 1. 1. Do The Campaign War Stories In This Order You can do campaign war stories in any order because they don’t actually connect to one another, as each tells a different story with a different player character on a different front of the war. You can do them in default order if you want, but here’s my rearrangement, now that I’m through them all.
War Story #5 – Nothing is Written – I feel like this one was saved for “last” because of its connection to Lawrence of Arabia and its use of the armored train as a boss, but it’s pretty short and not all that difficult, so I’m slotting it in earlier.
War Story #2 – Friends in High Places – Narratively, these pilot missions might be my favorite collection of the bunch, and this is a pretty decently long stretch of assignments. I almost put this last because of how much I like the ending, but I think that honor goes to…
War Story #4 – The Runner – Parts of these missions are hard, including a portion where you essentially have to take over an entire enemy fort single-handedly. And without saying anything about the story specifically, the way this tale plays out is the best note to end on, in my opinion, even if it lacks a thunderous boss battle like the war train.
2. Slow And Steady Wins the Campaign The difficulty curve of the Battlefield 1 campaign is all over the place, but the best advice I can give you is that slow and steady wins the race here. The game often goes for very, very long stretches of time without giving you checkpoints, unlike say, Call of Duty where every 10 feet will grant you a new respawn.
What that means is that you have to be even more careful than you would otherwise about making progress. Focus on killing enemies one or two at a time rather than going full Rambo. Many of these missions let you use stealth for at least a while, so take advantage of that whenever possible.
If you have to, run and hide. It may not be very heroic, but it will keep you alive and it’s better than having to re-kill the last 20 soldiers you took down just because you thought you’d take on a flamethrower with 15 health left. Patience is a virtue in many games, but especially here.
3. Be Creative, And You’ll Have More Fun
Many of these missions sort of leave it up to you as to how you want to take them on. In the beginning of The Runner, for instance, you can creep through a town to make you way from point A to point B, or you can literally sprint with a shotgun, too swift to ever really be pinned down by any enemies. Both are fun, both are productive, just do what feels right.
Similarly, in the final Arabian missions, one tasks you with taking out three outposts in the desert, which you can do in any order. One base has a small tank in the middle with a pilot ready to hop in at a moment’s notice. These missions are supposed to be about sneaking around and killing enemies covertly, but in that instance? Stab that pilot, hop in the tank and go hog wild on the entire base. The game is full of fun moments like this.
4. Look And ListenThis is pretty basic advice, but I highly recommend that you not just sprint through this entire campaign at a cheetah’s pace, and stop and take in the absolutely breathtaking world DICE has created here. This is always one of their strengths, but Battlefield 1 is more gorgeous than any Battlefield game before it, and Battlefront to boot. It’s just amazing.
But don’t just look, listen as well. Sound design is something we often overlook in games, but man, you just cannot miss it in Battlefield 1. From gunfire to explosions to tanks groaning and planes screaming, this is one of the best sounding games I’ve ever played, so be sure to absorb that as you play.
5. Don’t Fear The Armored Train
This will get a tiny bit spoilery for the last “boss” of the game, but not really. I just think it’s important to explain this because I was really frustrated until I figured it out.
The last boss of the Arabian section of the game is an armored train that will shoot you with turrets and rain down mortars on you frequently. The game instructs you to move to different anti-armor guns scattered around the desert map, and fire at the train. Each shot chips away about 5% of its health, but if you stay for even a fraction of a second too long at a gun, a mortar blast will essentially kill you in one hit, starting the entire encounter over.
I never got the train below maybe 60% health using this method, and was ready to throw my controller at the wall. But it was then I realized that despite what the game was telling me, there was a much easier way to kill the train. Scattered around the map are a few boxes with anti-tank grenades and most importantly, dynamite. As it turns out, you can skip the gun placements altogether and simply run up to the train directly, wallpapering it with dynamite and hucking tank grenades at it. Detonate a bunch of dynamite charges and you can take out half its life in one go. Watch for infantry around the tank, but yeah, this method was lifesaving right when the game was getting insanely frustrating.
6. Tag, Tag, Tag, Tag
Alright, we’ll move to multiplayer now, where some of this will be general Battlefield advice, with some specific to 1. In this case, it’s the former.
Tagging enemies as you sight them is sometimes even more important than shooting them, depending on your aim. This will paint a bright target on an enemy for your entire team to see, either saving a life or leading to the quick demise of the tagged. I rarely see anyone even in giant team matches regularly tagging people, but if you do, you are more of an asset to your team than anyone. Do not underestimate how valuable constant tagging is.
7. Stick With Your Squad
This may be a no brainer, but in almost no modes is it better to fly solo than to stick with your group. Spawn on them whenever you can, and dear lord, if you have a headset, use it. All the skill in the world will mean little if you’re going against a team that’s better coordinated than you, and having a squad that you communicate with regularly is key.
8. Attack Vehicles Together
This was one of my biggest complaints from multiplayer, that even being an assault class full of anti-vehicle weapons, actually killing vehicles was an enormous chore than almost always led to my death.
While I still believe anti-vehicle tech needs a buff in general, given the current state of the game, when you’re trying to take out a vehicle, you almost never want to do so solo. If you can coordinate with other members of your team, you’ll have a much better chance of success, because let me tell you, sprinting at a tank by yourself with a bundle of dynamite in your hand will often get very little done.
Again, it can be hard to organize this consistently, but this is why communication is key. There is very little you can do in Battlefield 1 entirely on your own, including vehicle-killing.
9. Wait For Your Medics
In any FPS when you die, your initial thought it to try to respawn as soon as possible so you can get back into the fight. This is all well and good except in a game like Battlefield 1 where a medic class can literally bring you back from the dead.
This is why the game gives you a handy “medic nearby” readout in the corner of your screen which shows their distance from you. Since you appear as a giant skull on their screen, they will definitely be trying to revive you if you let them, so don’t always skip the respawn timer, and just be patient. They are trying to get to you, if they’re close, I can promise you that. No medic wants to do anything more than be your guardian angel.10. Focus. On. Objectives.
While I know it’s nice to be the guy who goes 30-4 at the end of the game, if you got those stats by parking yourself on a far off rooftop and sniping for 30 minutes, taking exactly zero objectives, that’s sort of a problem.
It’s a larger problem when like, 10 members of your 30 person team are doing this, because they think it will help their K/D ratio. Look, a certain amount of overwatch is fine, but there’s a limit, and you have to focus on taking objectives.
I was never exactly on top of the kill leaderboards in my games, but I ended up as one of the top ranked players in many matches all the same because I simply took capture points. Run to one. Kill a guy or two. Plant yourself in a corner. Take the point. Defend if needed. Go to another point. It isn’t that complicated, and you can help contribute to your team’s victory even if you’re not a crack shot by simply focusing on taking or holding what objectives you can. It sounds simple, but it is amazing how many people ignore it.
That’s all I’ve got for now. This is hardly the most detailed strategy guide on earth, but I hope that it’s enough to get your started. Have fun! This is a hell of a game. ps check my videos out and music
