<h1>XxFEARTIPSxX(Fortnite):My Twitch Is:StealthBobmer2715(please follow me it helps)</h1>      
 
<p>.MAYBE YOU CAN WATCH SOME OF MY STREAMS TO LEARN MORE TO!!!!:On this website we will give you gamer tips for fortnite so you become a better player get high kill games and easy wins and easy kills.../alright 
here are some tips 1.don't use pyramids for stairs use them to put over someone's head in a building battle to get the high ground.
2. so if you lose the high first try to regain it if u cant then disengage or become a LOW GROUND WARRIOR. So hard scope with ur weapon the as soon as the peak then shoot bang 200 dmg headshot with u double barrel HEADSHOT!
3.just because 10 sensitivity looks scary it is actually good if you use it for like 30 minutes and always make sure you are using builder pro and have turbo building on so you can just spin in circles and hold down rt or r2.
4.this one is hard with practice well be easy put a floor then a wall then a stair(there different and easier ways to do this do whatever works)this 
will make it hard to shoot threw and so people can't pyramid you.5.when using a burst zoom in and out between burst shots so there's lees bloom.6.use 
pyramids instead of floors when blocking your fall because pyramids can lock in to more places than floors and you can use pyramids to go through big 
windows in trump tower (the biggest tower in the middle of tilted towers.7.build a one by one and put a pyramid at the top then go up to it and hold 
edit on it then you can see through it.8.Change your keybinds to what fits you.9.when you chase someone into a house and you think they're about to shoot 
you put a stair in there direction you may block there shot or even make them take damage from a rpg.10.when rotating to the circle rotate your stair
towards the enemy it will make you run faster and not to stop to place a wall.11. I Hope This Helped 
you get better at fortnite and I think you should watch on youtube ceeday, funny fortnite and bcc
they are some of my favorite YouTubers that do fortnite </p>
